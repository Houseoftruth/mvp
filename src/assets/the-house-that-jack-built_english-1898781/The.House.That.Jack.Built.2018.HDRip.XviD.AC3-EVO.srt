1
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:30,444
May I ask you something?

2
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:33,102
I can't promise I'll answer.

3
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:38,383
R -- right, that's exactly
what I meant.

4
00:00:38,417 --> 00:00:42,145
Um, are you allowed to speak
along the way?

5
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,975
I was thinking
there might be rules.

6
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,770
Let me put it this way

7
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:51,189
very few make it all the way
without uttering a word.

8
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:54,606
People are overcome with
a strange and sudden need

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,298
to confess on these trips.

10
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,473
And not all of it
can be said to be

11
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:02,096
of great rhetorical quality

12
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,444
but do carry on merrily

13
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:08,654
just don't believe you're
going to tell me something

14
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:10,725
I haven't heard before.

15
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,186
I will tentatively
divide my tale

16
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:26,534
into five randomly
chosen incidents

17
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:28,743
over a twelve-year period.

18
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:59,049
So I'm standing here
holding this jack

19
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:01,569
crap's not working.

20
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:04,193
Do you, uh, do you have a jack
I could borrow?

21
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:06,505
No, I'm sorry.

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,024
- No?
- No

23
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:09,715
- No?
- No

24
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:15,135
That's odd,
I thought everyone had a jack.

25
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,033
I don't.

26
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:19,553
Perhaps you could
have a look at my car?

27
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,868
Well, I don't have to
have a look at your car.

28
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,768
The issue with your jack
is it's broken.

29
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:29,045
There.

30
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:36,604
So, uh, what's a person
like me supposed to do?

31
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,470
Well, I suppose

32
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:44,371
I could, uh, drive over
to Sonny's repair shop

33
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:46,821
and call for roadside
assistance.

34
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:50,170
It's about, uh,
five miles from here.

35
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,654
What kind of repair shop is it?

36
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:54,001
It's -- it's..
Sonny's a blacksmith, very good one.

37
00:02:54,035 --> 00:02:56,279
Blacksmith.

38
00:02:56,314 --> 00:03:00,076
Well, maybe this Sonny can
repair the jack?

39
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,147
You'd have to talk to Sonny
about that.

40
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:06,738
Perhaps, I could entice you
to drive me there?

41
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:08,912
- Please.
- Um..

42
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:33,937
Oops, that was a mistake.

43
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,595
Mistake?

44
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,288
Me getting in this car
with you.

45
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:40,461
What was it one's mother
used to say

46
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:43,775
about not getting into cars
with strangers?

47
00:03:43,809 --> 00:03:45,984
Well..

48
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:48,814
I wouldn't know what
your mother said.

49
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,471
You might as well be
a serial killer.

50
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,130
I'm sorry but you do kind of
look like one.

51
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,754
You'd like me
to drive you back to your car?

52
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,931
No, no.
I can take care of myself.

53
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,762
I'm sorry,
were you offended

54
00:04:05,797 --> 00:04:07,626
that I called you
a serial killer?

55
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:09,973
No.

56
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,081
It's of absolutely
no importance to me.

57
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,742
Maybe it's just the van.

58
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:23,263
It's the kind one might expect
to be kidnapped in

59
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,817
or used to transport corpses.

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,648
But if you really were
a serial killer

61
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:30,960
I guess the easiest thing
would be just

62
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:35,930
to bury my body back up there
by those trees

63
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:38,174
but you'd have to remember
to dig six feet down

64
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,314
so the foxes couldn't
dig up my grave.

65
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:45,388
What would I do?

66
00:04:45,423 --> 00:04:48,288
What would I do to keep you
from getting away with it?

67
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,293
Of course, I'd just

68
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:56,330
pick up that jack and hit you
over the head with it.

69
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,194
A jack like that can do quite
a bit of damage

70
00:04:58,228 --> 00:04:59,437
don't you think?

71
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:03,544
I'm not a medical examiner.

72
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,960
It'd do quite a lot of damage.

73
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:30,433
Don't forget this.
Good luck with Sonny.

74
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:34,092
Um, would it be too much to ask
for you to drive me back?

75
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,128
If this Sonny is as fast as
you say he is?

76
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:41,168
I'm sure Sonny is perfectly
capable of giving you

77
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,687
a lift back to your..

78
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:44,792
As -- as I told you before,
I don't like

79
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,138
driving with strangers.

80
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:50,453
Well, I'm just as much of
a stranger as Sonny is.

81
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:51,868
Oh, getting along just fine.

82
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:53,767
I'll just go speak to Sonny,
just take a moment.

83
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:07,850
Sonny.

84
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,887
Hi, Jack.

85
00:06:10,922 --> 00:06:12,026
How's it going?

86
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:13,994
Well, I was working
on Miller's tractor

87
00:06:14,028 --> 00:06:17,273
but this lady is being
really persistent.

88
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:18,343
You don't say.

89
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,839
Big mistake.

90
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:34,290
The reason serial killers can
roam around free in our country

91
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:37,673
is that they have no connection
between themselves

92
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,260
and their victims.

93
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:41,815
So, you just made
a big mistake

94
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:43,713
letting Sonny see
the two of us together.

95
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:58,418
You know..

96
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,386
...honestly,
I have more important things

97
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,595
to be doing with my life

98
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,115
than messing around
with this crap.

99
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:08,635
You -- you said
he was really good.

100
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,844
Yeah, well,
I'm sure Sonny was just

101
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:13,985
distracted by your
goddamned blabbering.

102
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,228
Now I have to go,
I have an appointment.

103
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:17,782
Appointment,
what appointment?

104
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:23,235
That's none of your goddamn
business now, is it?

105
00:07:25,065 --> 00:07:27,239
You're not just gonna
leave me here.

106
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,621
In fact, yes, that is kind of
what I was thinking.

107
00:07:32,106 --> 00:07:35,351
I'm sure there will be another
serial killer passing by

108
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:37,629
who can give you a lift
back to Sonny's.

109
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,808
That is, unless he decides
to kill you first.

110
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,882
Even if I was to beg you
to drive me back?

111
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:50,470
Just a last time?

112
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,196
Pretty please.

113
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:09,696
You know,
I take it all back

114
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,044
what I said earlier about you
looking like a serial killer.

115
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:15,771
No, no, no,
you don't have the disposition

116
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:17,048
for that sort of thing.

117
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,846
You're way too much
of a wimp to murder anyone.

118
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:41,451
Oh, dear,
you are a dangerous man

119
00:08:41,486 --> 00:08:44,800
smacked her with a jack,
did you?

120
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,147
Honestly, I've heard of
more murders

121
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,908
than I can count.

122
00:08:49,943 --> 00:08:52,635
And by the way,
what does this ridiculous man

123
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,706
have to do with anything?

124
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,881
It's Glenn Gould

125
00:08:56,915 --> 00:08:59,539
one of the greatest piano
players of our time.

126
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,921
He represents art.

127
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:10,860
So a jack in the face of

128
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:15,106
an admittedly unbearable lady
was great art.

129
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,523
Is that what I'm to make of it?

130
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,975
Dear Mr. Verge,
please give me a chance

131
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:25,979
to cast some supplemental light
on the story of the jack.

132
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:29,776
The old cathedrals often have
sublime artworks hidden away

133
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,124
in the darkest corners
for only God to see

134
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:35,713
or whatever
one feels like calling

135
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,853
the great architect
behind it all.

136
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:41,097
The same goes for murder.

137
00:09:45,343 --> 00:09:47,621
When I say cathedrals

138
00:09:47,656 --> 00:09:52,108
it is first and foremost the
gothic buildings we admire.

139
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:55,525
Here elegant, pointed arches
have replaced the earlier

140
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,494
more primitive rounded arches.

141
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:02,636
The art of engineering is first
and foremost about statics

142
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,432
that is so things remain
standing in spite of

143
00:10:05,466 --> 00:10:08,677
the various forces that impact
the buildings.

144
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:13,474
In this way, the pointed arch
created a possibility to build

145
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:16,823
much higher
and with much more light

146
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:20,896
but most importantly
with less use of material.

147
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,347
I often say that
the material does the work.

148
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:27,868
In other words it has
a kind of will of its own

149
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:31,044
and by following it,
the result will be

150
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:32,459
the most exquisite.

151
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,394
So the material was the jack

152
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:40,156
and it jumped into the lady's
face on its own.

153
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,643
Art is many things.

154
00:10:45,196 --> 00:10:47,819
Very convenient and unusual

155
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:50,442
in the pile of bad excuses.

156
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:53,204
But all of that
is of no interest whatsoever

157
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:55,344
unless you're an engineer.

158
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,105
I am an engineer.

159
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:09,151
My mother was of the opinion
that becoming an engineer

160
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:13,189
was the more financially
viable choice

161
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:16,572
but my really big dream
was to become an architect.

162
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:24,131
Right before the lady
and the jack

163
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:25,926
I purchased a building lot

164
00:11:25,961 --> 00:11:29,067
and since
I was my own developer

165
00:11:29,102 --> 00:11:31,725
due to a substantial
inheritance

166
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,624
no one could keep me
from drawing up

167
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:37,662
my own plans
for my own house.

168
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:47,223
Engineer or architect

169
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:51,158
what I see is an OCD patient
in full bloom.

170
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:54,058
Ordnungszwang Jack

171
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:57,406
to use a good German word.

172
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,029
Yes, perhaps, it is
in any case true

173
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,377
that I suffered from
compulsions as a child.

174
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:06,656
I was completely hysterical
about cleaning

175
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,797
and could never leave
a room that wasn't

176
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,764
perfectly neat and clean.

177
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:13,698
A standard that was
difficult to maintain

178
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,873
in the walk-in freezer.

179
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:18,358
The walk-in freezer?

180
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,119
The walk-in freezer
on Prospect Avenue.

181
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:24,433
The sign has been broken
for forever

182
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:27,263
so no one really knew what
the name of the street was.

183
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,536
I bought the pizzas
from the former owner

184
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,745
of the walk-in freezer.

185
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,989
He claimed it was a great deal

186
00:13:03,023 --> 00:13:05,439
but of course I never managed
to sell them

187
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:08,546
so it all became
too much for me.

188
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,135
I only ate one of those
shitty pizzas.

189
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:15,449
Pizza, pizza!

190
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:28,704
And then there was a door
to another room

191
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:31,293
which I never managed to open.

192
00:13:40,681 --> 00:13:44,754
A fucking neurotic riddled
with obsessive compulsions

193
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,896
and a pathetic dream
of something greater.

194
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,363
And what about the police?

195
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:10,677
I imagine they started
coming around a lot.

196
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,822
No, call it luck
if you will.

197
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,343
I had attempted
to hide her car..

198
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,589
...but to my great annoyance

199
00:14:26,624 --> 00:14:30,007
you could still catch a glimpse
of it from the main road.

200
00:14:32,941 --> 00:14:35,944
You know, without realizing
where I had parked the car

201
00:14:35,978 --> 00:14:37,669
was a stroke of genius.

202
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:41,225
You see, the small brook
defines the state border

203
00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:42,951
and the local police,
per definition

204
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:45,056
can't see across state lines.

205
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:46,713
It's not their jurisdiction.

206
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:49,785
So I had no inquiries
from the police.

207
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:52,236
And by the way,
I don't even know if Sonny

208
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,720
had told them about me.

209
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:55,964
We met up quite
a few times since

210
00:14:55,998 --> 00:14:58,069
but never spoke of it.

211
00:16:30,092 --> 00:16:31,438
Hang on.

212
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,961
Hi.

213
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,997
Hi.

214
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,517
Who are you?

215
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:42,656
Police.

216
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,901
Did something happen?

217
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:47,213
Oh, no, no, no

218
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:50,630
luckily nothing exactly
has happened as of yet.

219
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,563
I understand that
you are fond of

220
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:56,912
shopping at
Carlson's Supermarket.

221
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,810
Why? Did something happen
at Carlson's?

222
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:03,505
No, uh, however
we'd like to, uh, prevent

223
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,543
things from happening
to businesses in the vicinity

224
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:12,341
like Carlson's Supermarket.

225
00:17:13,894 --> 00:17:17,001
Yeah, may -- may,
may I come in?

226
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,279
I'd like to see
a police badge.

227
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:22,903
So would I.

228
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,184
Unfortunately, that today

229
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,531
is going to be a bit of
a problem.

230
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,429
Now, ahem..

231
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:34,674
...I can tell by your expression

232
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,020
that you think it's a bad thing

233
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:39,196
that I don't have my police
badge on me.

234
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,231
Right.

235
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:41,405
Well, I'm here to tell you that

236
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:42,992
it's a, it's a good thing..

237
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,651
...for the police department

238
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,653
and I'm not going to
lie to you, okay?

239
00:17:48,688 --> 00:17:50,172
It also happens to be
a good thing for me

240
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:53,002
on a personal level. Yeah.

241
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:57,317
You see my...my badge

242
00:17:57,352 --> 00:18:00,458
it's, uh, at the silversmith.

243
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:02,426
Yeah, it's at the,
the silversmith.

244
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,086
They're...they're shining it up
and, ah..

245
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,401
...adding a few additional
citations to it.

246
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:13,989
I've been promoted.

247
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,029
- Okay.
- Right.

248
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,031
So now you're..

249
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:23,757
Now -- now what are you?

250
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,622
Like, what's your,
what's your rank now?

251
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:30,626
We're not at liberty
to discuss that.

252
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:33,284
Ah, that's considered
classified information.

253
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,461
However, I think this is safe
to say that

254
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:38,945
it's a considerable..

255
00:18:41,154 --> 00:18:42,397
...leap up the ladder.

256
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,918
- Uh, ahem, now may I --
- No.

257
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:49,438
Not without a badge.

258
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,753
Bravo, bravo, bravo,
that's excellent.

259
00:18:53,787 --> 00:18:57,170
That's exactly just the type of
response we like to see.

260
00:18:57,205 --> 00:19:01,174
- You say no, that makes my day.
- Right.

261
00:19:01,209 --> 00:19:04,419
Of course, everybody's always
talking about security

262
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:06,800
but what -- what is actually
anybody doing about it?

263
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:09,389
No, is quite
the correct answer.

264
00:19:09,424 --> 00:19:11,874
Yeah, it's quite
the correct answer indeed.

265
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:15,430
Of course you'll never allow
somebody in your home

266
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:18,053
just because they say,
"Oh, I'm a police officer."

267
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,848
No. No, no, no.
You don't do that.

268
00:19:19,882 --> 00:19:21,574
No.

269
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:23,817
You wait until they show you
the proper..

270
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:27,096
- Badge.
- Yeah. The badge.

271
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:29,651
- Yup.
- That's correct. Yeah.

272
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:30,755
Um..

273
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:36,278
May I, uh, ask you a..

274
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:40,800
...ah, somewhat
personal question?

275
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:44,252
Um, when exactly

276
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:47,186
was it that you lost your,
your husband?

277
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,708
It was just over
six months ago

278
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:55,159
that my husband passed..

279
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,885
Where are you going with this?

280
00:19:56,919 --> 00:19:59,750
Oh, I'm just thinking
about your..

281
00:19:59,784 --> 00:20:02,753
Your pension, yeah.

282
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,687
I bet with a simple phone call
to one of my colleagues

283
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:08,586
down in headquarters,
I could get you a, ah..

284
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,037
...considerable increase
in your pension.

285
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,970
I bet that I could,
I could double

286
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,592
what you're currently receiving.

287
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,389
Wait a minute.

288
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:23,152
You could get me
double my pension

289
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,154
from the police department
by calling people?

290
00:20:25,189 --> 00:20:27,674
Uh, forgive me, uh, uh..

291
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:31,299
...I, I've tricked you, a bit.

292
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,267
In fact, as it, as it stands

293
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:37,960
I'm not,
I'm not a police officer.

294
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,376
What?

295
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:42,344
I'm an insurance agent, lady.

296
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:45,313
The, the whole story
that I told you about the badge

297
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:49,834
that's, t-that's something
that we've been asked to do

298
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:53,459
by the authorities,
it's, it's for statistical

299
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:55,323
purposes or something.

300
00:20:56,496 --> 00:20:59,050
- Hi, Glenn.
- Hi, Claire.

301
00:20:59,085 --> 00:21:01,639
- It's my friend Glenn.
- Glenn. Yeah, great guy.

302
00:21:01,674 --> 00:21:03,469
- You know Glenn?
- Yeah, sure.

303
00:21:03,503 --> 00:21:05,712
Uh, listen, are you interested

304
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:08,336
in this, this increase,
uh, the money?

305
00:21:09,647 --> 00:21:11,615
Well, if you can double it.

306
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:14,203
It won't take more than
a few minutes of your time.

307
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:16,999
Alright, listen,
you can come in.

308
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:19,347
This damn door sticks.

309
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:21,141
I mean, what the heck's
the worst that could happen

310
00:21:21,176 --> 00:21:23,282
as long as you can
double my pension.

311
00:21:26,215 --> 00:21:28,666
Damn it.

312
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:29,874
Something wrong?

313
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,603
This is so damn humiliating.

314
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:40,989
You know being forced
to, to stand out there

315
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:44,717
exposed, time and time again

316
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:48,997
have to be
put in these situations

317
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,136
I don't know why.

318
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,587
Listen, I'm sorry,
uh, I-I.. I was jus..

319
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:54,623
You know
how humiliating it is?

320
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:59,145
I am constantly being
put in these situations.

321
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,629
It's just not fair.

322
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:01,906
- No.
- Do you think it's fair?

323
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:04,495
- No.
- No.

324
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,738
Do you want me
to get you a cup of tea?

325
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:08,706
Nah, nah, nah.
Don't worry about it.

326
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:16,576
Ow! Fuck.

327
00:22:16,611 --> 00:22:20,891
Ow! Fuck. Ah, fuck. Fuck.

328
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,757
The hell do you think
you're going?

329
00:23:09,146 --> 00:23:12,667
Oh, no. Oh, no.

330
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,914
Here.

331
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,433
Put this under your head.

332
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:26,612
I'm sorry. Ow.

333
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,381
I'm so sorry.

334
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,142
Oh..

335
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:43,525
What can I do
to make this good again?

336
00:23:48,357 --> 00:23:50,221
- What can I do?
- Ugh!

337
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:52,120
How can I help you?

338
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:53,432
What can I do
to make it better?

339
00:23:55,123 --> 00:23:57,643
- Speak to me?
- Talk..

340
00:23:57,677 --> 00:23:59,921
- Can't talk? Okay.
- Can't.

341
00:24:14,936 --> 00:24:16,627
Hold on a second.

342
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:20,251
I have something else I think
you're gonna like quite a bit.

343
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,702
Do you like donuts?

344
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,121
Shh.

345
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:35,266
Have here..

346
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:38,925
Here we go.

347
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,344
Yes, chamomile.

348
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:46,346
It's good for you.

349
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:09,404
Jesus Chri..

350
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,781
A murderer with OCD.

351
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:11,611
It's almost ridiculous

352
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:13,821
but how unfortunate
for you, Jack.

353
00:29:13,855 --> 00:29:17,859
And to top it off,
with cleaning compulsions.

354
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:23,743
Shit.

355
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:42,123
Please get out of the car, sir.

356
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:58,243
Do you mind if I take a look
in the van please, sir?

357
00:34:02,212 --> 00:34:05,215
- I'd be a bad guy if I said no.
- Alright, open her up, please.

358
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,389
Okay.

359
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:16,088
I'm sorry, sir, but there's
been a minor break-in

360
00:34:16,123 --> 00:34:18,539
down the street just now.

361
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:19,816
I'd like to ask you
a couple of questions

362
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:22,922
about anything you may
have seen or heard, yeah?

363
00:34:22,957 --> 00:34:26,098
Glenn said you were
visiting Claire.

364
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:28,756
I'm sorry y -- you said something
ab -- about a break-in?

365
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,137
- Uh-huh.
- Well..

366
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,728
Well, unfortunately
I think you've got

367
00:34:35,763 --> 00:34:37,696
a more serious problem.

368
00:34:38,628 --> 00:34:41,907
Claire, she's disappeared.

369
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,049
Clair Miller has disappeared?

370
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:49,363
Yeah, I've been,
uh, sitting out here

371
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:52,642
for the last two hours
in my van waiting for her.

372
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:54,092
Right.

373
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:56,577
You see, ahem,
I contacted Claire

374
00:34:56,611 --> 00:35:00,581
because, uh, her late husband
was a dear friend of mine.

375
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:02,169
We worked together
for number of years

376
00:35:02,203 --> 00:35:05,620
on the railroad
and, uh, I'm a collector.

377
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:07,139
Yeah, I collect.

378
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:10,349
Uh, I collect Trax.

379
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:11,523
- Trax?
- Old issues of Trax.

380
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:15,285
It's a, uh, publication
owned by the railroad

381
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,702
and, uh, Jerry, uh

382
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:20,497
I know, I happen
to know for a fact

383
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:23,707
that he also subscribed
and was an enthusiast

384
00:35:23,742 --> 00:35:25,606
such as myself.

385
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,850
So Claire said
she'd run inside

386
00:35:28,885 --> 00:35:30,369
and see if she could rustle up

387
00:35:30,404 --> 00:35:33,303
a couple of back issues for me.

388
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:34,960
She didn't ask me in.

389
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:35,995
Right.

390
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,687
Better safe than sorry

391
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,759
when an oddball like myself
just turns up, right?

392
00:35:40,793 --> 00:35:43,865
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

393
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:48,629
So I knocked several times
and, uh, she hasn't answered.

394
00:35:48,663 --> 00:35:50,941
Okay.

395
00:35:50,976 --> 00:35:54,048
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to stay right here.

396
00:35:54,082 --> 00:35:55,843
I'm just gonna go take a look.

397
00:36:11,445 --> 00:36:13,654
Claire, it's Ed.

398
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:19,280
- Maybe the door is open.
- What?

399
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:22,180
Or maybe not.

400
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,413
Claire, you here?

401
00:36:53,107 --> 00:36:54,350
Claire?

402
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,668
- Is she up there?
- No, she's not up there.

403
00:37:02,703 --> 00:37:04,912
Maybe she went out
through the back.

404
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:07,880
I, I think
I would have noticed that.

405
00:37:07,915 --> 00:37:12,402
Uh, this is really,
really strange.

406
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:13,852
If you ask me, I'd say

407
00:37:13,886 --> 00:37:16,613
that this needs to be
thoroughly investigated.

408
00:37:16,648 --> 00:37:18,028
Right, well
I'm not askin' you.

409
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:20,548
You know, I have to say,
also, that I heard

410
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:25,312
uh, some noises coming
from...the living room.

411
00:37:25,346 --> 00:37:27,279
- Noises?
- Yeah, some noises.

412
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:29,971
I, I, of course, I can't be sure

413
00:37:30,006 --> 00:37:31,973
but it sounded
a little bit like a..

414
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:33,803
Like a scuffle of some kind.

415
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,770
Scuffle?

416
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:38,428
No, no, no. You're gonna have
to put that back down, now.

417
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:41,259
Sir, that kind of investigation,
that's for police, don't.

418
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,570
Right, right.

419
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:45,263
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave the house.

420
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,404
- I'm sorry?
- Sir, now!

421
00:37:48,438 --> 00:37:50,302
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

422
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:52,511
You know, I'm gonna
do so under protest.

423
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:56,032
I, I feel like
that my observations

424
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,587
well, they could be of use
in an investigation.

425
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:02,728
As a tax-paying citizen,
someone who is fully aware

426
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:04,454
of my constitutional rights.

427
00:38:04,489 --> 00:38:05,731
What?

428
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:08,320
O -- officer, please
allow me to finish

429
00:38:08,355 --> 00:38:11,116
I'm just trying to be
of assistance, okay?

430
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,186
You've got one minute, sir.

431
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,843
I would like
to recommend one thing

432
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,707
and it's within my right,

433
00:38:15,741 --> 00:38:19,849
that this room
is inspected impeccably.

434
00:38:21,402 --> 00:38:25,510
With a magnifying glass
if you catch my drift.

435
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:28,892
- Get out.
- Have a nice day, officer.

436
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:30,377
Get out, sir.

437
00:39:23,084 --> 00:39:28,158

Don't the police officers
in your story

442
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:47,661
seem exceptionally naive?

443
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:49,939
Is that the point?

444
00:39:49,973 --> 00:39:54,668
No, but here it comes,
the point that is.

445
00:39:54,702 --> 00:39:56,635
I can hardly wait.

446
00:40:06,852 --> 00:40:08,613
The great rain!

447
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:14,066
It washed away the long track
from my escape.

448
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:18,416
Now, I don't consider myself

449
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,522
a decidedly
devoted man of faith.

450
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:24,974
Which, of course, is a
totally crazy thing to say

451
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:28,080
considering
our present situation

452
00:40:28,115 --> 00:40:30,497
but I must admit..

453
00:40:30,531 --> 00:40:34,259
...I experienced the rain,
the fiercest I have ever seen

454
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:37,642
as a kind of a blessing.

455
00:40:37,676 --> 00:40:41,542
And the murder
as a kind of liberation.

456
00:40:41,577 --> 00:40:44,200
I felt I had
a higher protector.

457
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,895
And in the reality you were

458
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:52,864
just a terrifying
perverted Satan.

459
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,981
But, did you understand,
or even better, did you accept

460
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:10,502
the connection
to your own personality?

461
00:41:10,537 --> 00:41:14,126
That you yourself
were a psychopath?

462
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:23,929
Well, I'm not stupid.

463
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,244
That's rather unusual.

464
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,453
The psychopath
will never accept

465
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,559
his own diagnosis.

466
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,149
But I did!

467
00:41:37,184 --> 00:41:39,427
For instance,
the psychopath's

468
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:41,913
lack of empathy.

469
00:41:41,947 --> 00:41:45,917
I went to great lengths
to fake normal empathy..

470
00:41:45,951 --> 00:41:49,127
...in order to hide
amongst the masses.

471
00:41:49,161 --> 00:41:51,543
Smile.

472
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:56,928
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

473
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:04,418
Disappointed.

474
00:42:05,868 --> 00:42:09,147
Very, very disappointed.

475
00:42:24,887 --> 00:42:29,961

00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:36,105
♪ Fame fame.. ♪

478
00:42:36,139 --> 00:42:37,555
And the reeds?

479
00:42:38,763 --> 00:42:41,731
I was a very sensitive child..

480
00:42:41,766 --> 00:42:44,596
...profoundly
afraid of playing.

481
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:46,943
For example, hide and seek.

482
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:48,566
In the case of hide

483
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,603
I always chose to run
in near panic

484
00:42:51,638 --> 00:42:54,917
into a field
of reeds to hide.

485
00:42:54,951 --> 00:42:58,817
I see something
other than a scared kid.

486
00:42:58,852 --> 00:43:02,580
I see a kid with a more
mysterious goal.

487
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:06,756
The choice of the dash through
the reeds was an escape

488
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:09,759
but also an open
invitation to the pursuer

489
00:43:09,794 --> 00:43:14,937
because of the clear path
of broken reeds left behind.

490
00:43:14,971 --> 00:43:18,112
Was there an element
of come and catch me

491
00:43:18,147 --> 00:43:20,045
in you as a child?

492
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,186
Or perhaps, more importantly

493
00:43:23,221 --> 00:43:25,326
in you as a person?

494
00:43:27,674 --> 00:43:30,918
Was there never a tiny grain
of disappointment

495
00:43:30,953 --> 00:43:34,094
about the great rain
that washed away

496
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:37,028
your tracks so you
couldn't be caught?

497
00:43:37,062 --> 00:43:39,306
More like amazement..

498
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,620
...when I think about all the
things I've done in my life

499
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:46,037
without it, in any way,
resulting in punishment.

500
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:07,092
I loved when the men
from the village

501
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:09,405
cut the meadows
with their scythes.

502
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:19,380
Back then one spoke
of the breath of the meadow.

503
00:44:20,865 --> 00:44:22,729
Everyone working in rhythm

504
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:25,870
exhaling when they mowed,
and inhaling when they pulled

505
00:44:25,904 --> 00:44:27,250
the scythes back.

506
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:53,345
It was as if the meadow
lived at its fullest

507
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,106
in my consciousness..

508
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,522
...when I listened
to its breath.

509
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:24,126
Stop that.

510
00:46:26,749 --> 00:46:28,026
Stop it.

511
00:46:30,063 --> 00:46:31,858
Stop it!

512
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:36,586
Stop it!

513
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:01,991
Experience had taught me
how to strangle correctly

514
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:03,890
and for long enough.

515
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:14,038
Bravo, Jack!

516
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:18,180
You certainly
are clever and tough..

517
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:20,976
...just like
all the other criminals.

518
00:47:41,824 --> 00:47:45,793
The fact is, when,
after several more murders

519
00:47:45,828 --> 00:47:48,555
I felt my OCD diminish

520
00:47:48,589 --> 00:47:50,868
I started to take
greater chances.

521
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:03,871
This time I was completely
dissatisfied with the pictures

522
00:49:03,906 --> 00:49:06,322
so I decided to take new ones.

523
00:49:42,565 --> 00:49:45,258
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck it!

524
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:12,078
Shit!

525
00:50:12,112 --> 00:50:14,287
It struck me like lightning
from a clear sky.

526
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:15,322
Fuck!

527
00:50:15,357 --> 00:50:16,530
I couldn't resist running

528
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:18,015
that little old lady over.

529
00:50:19,499 --> 00:50:22,053
It made my already rather
daring plan of bringing

530
00:50:22,088 --> 00:50:24,366
the first body back
to the scene of the murder

531
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,265
in order to take
some more inspired photos

532
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,888
a great deal more dangerous.

533
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:32,546
I now had a severely
hemorrhaging body

534
00:50:32,581 --> 00:50:37,068
and another body in a bizarre,
frozen position on my hands.

535
00:50:37,103 --> 00:50:38,656
Goddammit!

536
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:47,009
♪ Fame fame fame fame ♪ Fame fame ♪

537
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,218
Could you elaborate a little

538
00:50:49,253 --> 00:50:52,221
on why the old lady had to die?

539
00:50:52,256 --> 00:50:56,398
I can't explain it all,
but perhaps I can describe it

540
00:50:56,432 --> 00:50:58,262
as the kind of blood frenzy

541
00:50:58,296 --> 00:51:01,230
an ermine experiences
in a hen house.

542
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:05,441
Do you know Blake's poems..

543
00:51:05,476 --> 00:51:07,616
...about the lamb
and the tiger?

544
00:51:08,755 --> 00:51:12,448
I do know Blake superficially

545
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:17,074
but I'm afraid I won't escape
a comprehensive tutorial.

546
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:22,079
God created both
the lamb and the tiger.

547
00:51:24,391 --> 00:51:26,393
The lamb represents innocence

548
00:51:26,428 --> 00:51:28,913
and the tiger represents
savagery.

549
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:31,916
Both parts are perfect
and necessary.

550
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,952
The tiger lives
on blood and murder

551
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:35,920
kills the lamb..

552
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:39,544
...and that is also
the artist's nature.

553
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:43,617
You read Blake like
the devil reads the Bible.

554
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:46,965
After all, the poor lamb
didn't ask to die

555
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,246
in order to become even
the greatest art.

556
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,731
The lamb has been bestowed
with the honor of living

557
00:51:53,765 --> 00:51:57,044
forever in art,
and art is divine.

558
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:04,776
But still the same red van.
Now all bloody.

559
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:06,606
Somewhat reckless,
I should think

560
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,918
if you don't want
to be found out.

561
00:52:10,886 --> 00:52:14,234
Now, that's exactly
what I thought..

562
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:16,857
...but I didn't have
the strength to change it

563
00:52:16,892 --> 00:52:19,998
and besides, everything was
still going remarkably well.

564
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,866
Sometimes the best way
to hide is to not hide at all.

565
00:52:41,296 --> 00:52:47,094
But now, as I said,
the OCD was on decline..

566
00:52:47,129 --> 00:52:50,546
...so I took deliberate risks
and didn't remove the blood

567
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:53,377
from either the bedroom
or the car.

568
00:52:53,411 --> 00:52:56,690
It was actually quite
liberating to reach that point.

569
00:53:00,763 --> 00:53:05,043
It turned out the little old
lady who was merely an accident

570
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:09,220
added a great touch of humor
to my staged photographs.

571
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:11,395
And I was very pleased
with the outcome.

572
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:22,268
Sophistication.

573
00:53:23,648 --> 00:53:26,824
Mr. Sophistication? Of course!

574
00:53:26,858 --> 00:53:30,068
Your narcissism
knows no bounds.

575
00:53:37,283 --> 00:53:39,388
I sent the picture
to the local paper

576
00:53:39,423 --> 00:53:42,736
which usually distinguished
itself by running stories

577
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:47,258
about missing, not to say,
uh, stolen garden gates

578
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:50,744
and so, might do well
with a story with a, you know

579
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:53,022
little more bite.

580
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:55,922
For me though, what was really
sensational about the work

581
00:53:55,956 --> 00:53:58,511
with the photo,
it wasn't the image

582
00:53:58,545 --> 00:54:00,306
but the negative.

583
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:05,828
When I was ten years old,
I discovered

584
00:54:05,863 --> 00:54:08,245
that through the negative,
you could see

585
00:54:08,279 --> 00:54:12,697
the real inner
demonic quality of the light.

586
00:54:12,732 --> 00:54:14,389
The dark light.

587
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:06,510
But what about
repentance, Jack?

588
00:55:06,544 --> 00:55:10,376
The ones I deal with tend
to repent all over the place.

589
00:55:12,378 --> 00:55:14,311
I repent nothing

590
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:16,934
no matter how long
we have to walk

591
00:55:16,968 --> 00:55:19,833
but I did think
of something the other day.

592
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:23,147
Imagine a man
walking down a street

593
00:55:23,181 --> 00:55:25,667
underneath the street lamps.

594
00:55:25,701 --> 00:55:28,290
Right under a light
his shadow is the densest

595
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,706
but also the tiniest.

596
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:32,363
Then when he starts to move

597
00:55:32,398 --> 00:55:35,193
his shadow grows
in front of him.

598
00:55:35,228 --> 00:55:37,817
The shadow becomes
bigger and bigger

599
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:41,027
while it thins out
and the shadow behind him

600
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,581
from the next lamppost emerges

601
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:46,481
and becomes
shorter and shorter

602
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:48,931
until it reaches
its ultimate density

603
00:55:48,966 --> 00:55:52,728
as the man stands directly
underneath the light.

604
00:55:52,763 --> 00:55:54,420
Let's say that the man standing

605
00:55:54,454 --> 00:55:56,698
underneath the first lamppost
is me

606
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:58,493
when I've just
committed a murder.

607
00:55:58,527 --> 00:56:01,599
I feel strong and content.

608
00:56:01,634 --> 00:56:05,914
I start to walk and the shadow
in front of me grows bigger

609
00:56:05,948 --> 00:56:08,882
like my pleasure,
but at the same time

610
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:12,610
pain is on its way,
represented by the shadow

611
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:15,302
behind me
from the next lamppost

612
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:19,203
and at the midpoint
between the lampposts

613
00:56:19,237 --> 00:56:23,621
the pain is so great
it outweighs my pleasure.

614
00:56:23,656 --> 00:56:26,728
And with every step forward
pleasure dissolves

615
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:29,524
and pain
intensifies behind me.

616
00:56:29,558 --> 00:56:33,631
Finally the pain
is so unbearably intense

617
00:56:33,666 --> 00:56:36,565
that I have to act,
so when I reach the point

618
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,154
with the next lamp in zenith

619
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:40,776
I will kill again.

620
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:47,127
I know you want
to be someone special, Jack

621
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:50,372
but let's face it,
this illustration can be used

622
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,306
for any addict's tale of woe.

623
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,067
The alcoholic empties
the bottle at the zenith

624
00:56:56,102 --> 00:56:57,690
et cetera, et cetera.

625
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,348
But what about the family?

626
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:11,600
I understand that your
occupation didn't leave

627
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:14,500
any room for a family
in your life.

628
00:57:14,534 --> 00:57:17,261
No, why?

629
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:20,195
Well, it could be,
despite everything

630
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:23,232
that speculating about this
might have triggered

631
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:26,166
just a tiny bit
of human feeling.

632
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:31,586
For example, a variation on
what those of us less clever

633
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,553
might call need.

634
00:57:33,588 --> 00:57:36,314
Need? Because
I never had a family?

635
00:57:36,349 --> 00:57:39,352
No, I can't say that it did.

636
00:57:39,386 --> 00:57:42,873
But the concept of family
actually inspired

637
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,289
one of my greatest works.

638
00:58:10,797 --> 00:58:12,661
Okay, hats for everyone

639
00:58:12,696 --> 00:58:14,767
you are to keep
your hats on at all times.

640
00:58:14,801 --> 00:58:17,321
- Thank you.
- Safety procedures.

641
00:58:23,569 --> 00:58:25,122
Can we go up there, mom?

642
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:27,193
Of course we're gonna go up.

643
00:58:27,227 --> 00:58:29,851
Smile, grumpy, it'll be fun.

644
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:32,060
I don't think so.

645
00:58:32,094 --> 00:58:34,718
It's for your sake we've come
all the way out here.

646
00:58:34,752 --> 00:58:37,341
I told you I didn't wanna go.

647
00:58:37,375 --> 00:58:38,791
You wanna see the weapons?

648
00:58:41,069 --> 00:58:44,003
This, George, is a rifle.

649
00:58:44,037 --> 00:58:47,385
This rifle has the capacity
to hit its target

650
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,630
at a distance
of several 100 yards.

651
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:52,114
And kill larger animals.

652
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:56,947
Have you killed
any large animals?

653
00:58:57,672 --> 00:58:59,846
Well, yes, I have.

654
00:58:59,881 --> 00:59:01,814
But that's not something
that I'm proud of.

655
00:59:01,848 --> 00:59:04,195
If I'd killed
some large animals

656
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,576
I'd be proud of it.

657
00:59:05,611 --> 00:59:09,338
I guess that's where
you and I differ, Georgie.

658
00:59:09,373 --> 00:59:11,133
This here is a shotgun.

659
00:59:12,618 --> 00:59:15,275
It's what they call
a smoothbore weapon.

660
00:59:15,310 --> 00:59:17,795
This is not as precise
as the rifle

661
00:59:17,830 --> 00:59:19,797
but it's more effective

662
00:59:19,832 --> 00:59:21,868
when the animal is closer
and moving.

663
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:25,147
You can touch it if you want.

664
00:59:25,182 --> 00:59:26,459
Can I?

665
00:59:28,012 --> 00:59:29,531
Yeah.

666
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,740
Are we going hunting?

667
00:59:31,775 --> 00:59:32,741
No.

668
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,055
Hunting is such
an unpleasant thing.

669
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:42,130
I used to hunt quite a bit,
but I've stopped.

670
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:44,132
Why?

671
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:48,619
To be honest,
I find hunting distasteful.

672
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:51,760
For example, if I wanted
to shoot some of the crows

673
00:59:51,795 --> 00:59:54,625
up in that tree,
we'd be talking about

674
00:59:54,660 --> 00:59:58,353
what is known as culling,
which quite simply means

675
00:59:58,387 --> 01:00:02,288
you want to determine which
animals you are going to allow

676
01:00:02,322 --> 01:00:03,910
to live in your forest.

677
01:00:05,153 --> 01:00:07,396
The crow has no value as prey

678
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:10,468
but can be culled because
they are seen as something

679
01:00:10,503 --> 01:00:14,438
of a threat to animals
you wanna cultivate.

680
01:00:15,819 --> 01:00:20,375
Culling, it's also such
an unpleasant word.

681
01:00:20,409 --> 01:00:24,482
It has a tinge of ethnic
cleansing about it.

682
01:00:24,517 --> 01:00:28,417
The very sick
and twisted act of hunting

683
01:00:28,452 --> 01:00:30,523
has been ritualized

684
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:33,802
to such an unsettling degree.

685
01:00:33,837 --> 01:00:36,529
The battue, for example

686
01:00:36,563 --> 01:00:39,049
where a row of beaters
scares the living daylight

687
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,844
out of an entire forest.

688
01:00:43,294 --> 01:00:46,159
Not to mention the trophy
parade, practiced primarily

689
01:00:46,194 --> 01:00:48,541
in Europe
at the end of the hunt

690
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:50,612
as a final insult

691
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,236
in which each species
has its own traditional place.

692
01:00:54,271 --> 01:00:56,480
We want to go up
in the tower, mom.

693
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:57,895
Shh. George, wait.

694
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:00,070
Yep, we are going up.

695
01:01:09,804 --> 01:01:11,944
Okay, George,
you want to shoot?

696
01:01:18,502 --> 01:01:21,160
I'll aim..

697
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:22,609
...you pull the trigger.

698
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:26,959
Fire!

699
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:30,997
Excellent!

700
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:40,248
To fell an animal of this size

701
01:01:40,282 --> 01:01:42,319
you have to be sure
to hit it in the vitals

702
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:45,115
which is to say here,
in the area of the lungs.

703
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:49,084
As you can see,
this one was hit here

704
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,500
in the hind quarter.

705
01:01:51,535 --> 01:01:53,054
An animal could run
a great distance

706
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:55,435
with an injury such as this.

707
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,541
That's why typically
a good hunter would have

708
01:01:57,575 --> 01:02:02,304
a Schweiss-dog, that's trained
in following a blood trail

709
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:05,238
so you can track the animal
down and finish the job.

710
01:02:07,413 --> 01:02:12,383
Schweiss, well, that's
the word we use for blood trail.

711
01:02:12,418 --> 01:02:16,353
Congratulations, young Georgie,
you hit the animal.

712
01:02:18,217 --> 01:02:22,393
So you had found yourself
a family?

713
01:02:22,428 --> 01:02:27,571
Yes, that's also how
I like to see it.

714
01:02:30,505 --> 01:02:34,371
But it's all so much
simpler with animals.

715
01:02:34,405 --> 01:02:36,580
What do you mean?

716
01:02:36,614 --> 01:02:39,134
The order is important.

717
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:42,724
The hind will typically run in
the front with the largest fawn

718
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,071
following the smallest last.

719
01:02:45,106 --> 01:02:46,659
You'd typically shoot
at the deer

720
01:02:46,693 --> 01:02:48,143
starting with the rear one

721
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:51,526
based on the fact that the two
older animals can survive

722
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:53,114
without the young one

723
01:02:53,148 --> 01:02:55,979
whereas, if you shot
the mother first

724
01:02:56,013 --> 01:02:57,912
and didn't get the others

725
01:02:57,946 --> 01:03:00,984
both fawns would probably
not survive.

726
01:03:01,018 --> 01:03:04,366
So in this manner,
you then shoot the bigger fawn

727
01:03:04,401 --> 01:03:06,403
and then the mother last.

728
01:03:10,614 --> 01:03:12,616
Stay down!

729
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:20,693
Stop! George!

730
01:03:22,729 --> 01:03:24,801
George!

731
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:27,665
My family was moving
in the wrong order.

732
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,634
I have always taken
ethical hunting rules

733
01:03:30,668 --> 01:03:32,843
very seriously.

734
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:37,192
On that point, I think of
myself as a bit of a gentleman.

735
01:03:39,022 --> 01:03:40,817
A gentleman, really?

736
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:42,163
Hmm.

737
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,924
Or a Mr. Sophistication even?

738
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:12,987
No! No!

739
01:04:17,094 --> 01:04:18,026
No!

740
01:04:49,264 --> 01:04:51,715
George doesn't seem to have
much of an appetite.

741
01:04:54,131 --> 01:04:56,375
Perhaps he'd like
some of that pie.

742
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:07,386
You know, when I was a boy,
I never got enough pie.

743
01:05:09,526 --> 01:05:11,148
Why don't you do as I say..

744
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:15,221
...and give the youngster
a little piece of pie?

745
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:20,709
It's if have no say
in the matter.

746
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:30,133
This was supposed to be
an enjoyable picnic.

747
01:05:42,697 --> 01:05:44,699
This has been a good day.

748
01:05:48,082 --> 01:05:49,807
An excellent day.

749
01:05:53,294 --> 01:05:55,123
Do you have a favorite number?

750
01:05:57,677 --> 01:05:58,955
Any number?

751
01:06:00,853 --> 01:06:02,613
Everybody has
a favorite number.

752
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:11,795
Twelve.

753
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:13,038
Twelve.

754
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:17,318
That's an excellent number.

755
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,737
Very good number indeed.

756
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,465
Picnic's over.

757
01:06:29,054 --> 01:06:30,779
You can go ahead.

758
01:06:32,919 --> 01:06:34,991
I'll take care of the kids.

759
01:06:42,584 --> 01:06:43,965
One.

760
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,450
Two.

761
01:06:47,555 --> 01:06:49,798
Three.

762
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,076
Four.

763
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,871
Five.

764
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:55,321
Six.

765
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:56,633
Seven.

766
01:06:57,944 --> 01:06:59,118
Eight.

767
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:01,741
Nine.

768
01:07:03,122 --> 01:07:04,744
Ten.

769
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:06,160
Eleven.

770
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:09,922
Twelve.

771
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:41,505
Schweiss.

772
01:07:43,714 --> 01:07:45,302
Exactly.

773
01:09:54,086 --> 01:09:56,847
Do you expect me
to praise you or applaud?

774
01:09:56,882 --> 01:09:59,402
You know, I'm sad

775
01:09:59,436 --> 01:10:01,818
that you're
so judgmental, Verge.

776
01:10:01,852 --> 01:10:05,718
Don't look at the acts,
look at the works.

777
01:10:05,753 --> 01:10:07,306
The whole notion of trophies.

778
01:10:07,341 --> 01:10:10,344
No. No, no, no!

779
01:10:10,378 --> 01:10:13,726
You're constantly
trying to manipulate me.

780
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:15,625
And with children

781
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:18,041
the most sensitive
subject of all.

782
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:21,424
I'm also sensitive, Verge.

783
01:10:24,461 --> 01:10:27,775
I cannot sleep on a sheet with
even the smallest wrinkle.

784
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:34,885
The hunt, after all,
is a metaphor for love.

785
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:37,474
And that is your weakness,
Jack.

786
01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:40,684
So much has happened
during those days

787
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:43,377
let's call it signs
in the sun and the moon

788
01:10:43,411 --> 01:10:47,173
which claimed my presence
for yet another work of art

789
01:10:47,208 --> 01:10:49,417
and roused my aggression.

790
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:00,911
First, the eclipse.

791
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:07,746
Then the volcanic eruption
of Mount St. Helens

792
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,024
which I could see
from my lot.

793
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:13,303
I had just then decided
that using cinder blocks

794
01:11:13,338 --> 01:11:16,030
was totally, totally wrong.

795
01:11:17,445 --> 01:11:19,447
So I decided
to change the material.

796
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:22,761
The divine material.

797
01:11:24,487 --> 01:11:26,420
Love, Jack.

798
01:11:26,454 --> 01:11:28,974
Love is also an art.

799
01:11:29,008 --> 01:11:30,872
Not to mention intimacy.

800
01:11:36,464 --> 01:11:39,605
The Iceman always inhaled
his victims' last breath.

801
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:41,227
Jack!

802
01:11:41,262 --> 01:11:43,540

803
01:11:43,575 --> 01:11:45,473

Verge?

807
01:13:37,171 --> 01:13:38,862
I'm here, Jack.

808
01:13:49,873 --> 01:13:51,599
I don't feel so good, Verge.

809
01:13:55,879 --> 01:13:58,779
There's a sour taste
in my mouth.

810
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:02,299
You want me to show you the
way to the next whiskey bar?

811
01:14:06,338 --> 01:14:09,237
It's the acid
you are starting to taste.

812
01:14:11,136 --> 01:14:13,207
It appears at this depth.

813
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:19,144
I'm afraid you are going
to have to get used to it.

814
01:14:34,608 --> 01:14:37,611
I placed Grumpy
in the anteroom..

815
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:41,856
...and left him there
until rigor mortis

816
01:14:41,891 --> 01:14:43,271
had disappeared.

817
01:14:44,859 --> 01:14:47,931
I had a plan
for little Grumpy.

818
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:51,487
What does that mean?

819
01:14:54,317 --> 01:14:58,148
Those who are really good
at taxidermy

820
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:00,737
can make the animals
look alive

821
01:15:00,772 --> 01:15:03,740
by changing their expressions
and positions

822
01:15:05,086 --> 01:15:08,434
so it becomes
a whole little scene.

823
01:15:08,469 --> 01:15:12,404
I discovered that if I worked
around rigor mortis

824
01:15:12,438 --> 01:15:15,303
and worked before
the corpses froze

825
01:15:15,338 --> 01:15:19,066
then I could manipulate
their expressions

826
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,656
and positions with
steel wire, pins, tape

827
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,727
and things like that.

828
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:26,729
And then when they were frozen

829
01:15:26,763 --> 01:15:29,110
remove it all
and have a nearly

830
01:15:29,145 --> 01:15:31,043
credible human being.

831
01:15:31,078 --> 01:15:34,391
Grumpy was grumpy no more.

832
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:37,187
Was that what you were after?

833
01:15:37,222 --> 01:15:40,397
A completely credible
human being?

834
01:15:40,432 --> 01:15:43,642
Without becoming too romantic,
might one say

835
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:46,921
that exactly that
is reminiscent

836
01:15:46,956 --> 01:15:49,579
of a kind of desire
for love?

837
01:15:49,614 --> 01:15:52,340
I had a romance.

838
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:14,362
Where did the crutch
come from, Jack?

839
01:16:14,397 --> 01:16:17,676
You hadn't hurt yourself,
had you?

840
01:16:17,711 --> 01:16:21,404
A very useful little trick
if you wish to look harmless.

841
01:16:21,438 --> 01:16:25,615
In general, if you carry some
luggage and a crutch

842
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:28,238
people come running
to assist

843
01:16:28,273 --> 01:16:30,724
and then you force them
into the car with a weapon.

844
01:16:30,758 --> 01:16:33,381
What does that
have to do with love?

845
01:16:35,901 --> 01:16:38,904
I really had strong feelings
for this one

846
01:16:38,939 --> 01:16:42,770
much stronger than a psychopath
should be able to have.

847
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:53,747
Smile.

848
01:17:06,207 --> 01:17:07,484
Hey.

849
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:13,249
Talk to me.

850
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:15,631
I can't.

851
01:17:16,839 --> 01:17:18,944
I hate the way you look at me.

852
01:17:25,088 --> 01:17:26,711
The way I look at you?

853
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:31,819
Okay.

854
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:11,928
Can you tell me
what's on your mind now?

855
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,626
I just don't know
where I've got you.

856
01:18:22,767 --> 01:18:25,424
Are you trying to leave me?

857
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:27,495
I feel like you're trying
to leave me.

858
01:18:29,014 --> 01:18:30,706
I'm not going to leave you.

859
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:34,088
I'm right here.

860
01:18:42,545 --> 01:18:43,822
You feel that?

861
01:18:46,929 --> 01:18:49,863
I'm right here,
on the other end of the line.

862
01:18:56,214 --> 01:18:57,663
Hang up for a second.

863
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,367
- Hello.
- Who am I speaking with?

864
01:19:15,854 --> 01:19:17,856
You know who
you are speaking with.

865
01:19:21,273 --> 01:19:23,241
You know I'd never leave you.

866
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:26,865
Now what do you say?

867
01:19:30,455 --> 01:19:32,457
Don't you think we deserve
a drink?

868
01:19:35,046 --> 01:19:36,841
Sure.

869
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:38,497
I'll be over shortly
for cocktails.

883
01:20:31,378 --> 01:20:33,414
Is that being crude?

01:20:43,908 --> 01:20:45,668
Tigers have stripes.

888
01:20:45,702 --> 01:20:47,083
And where do they live?

889
01:20:49,879 --> 01:20:51,191
Africa?

890
01:20:56,161 --> 01:20:59,130
And the difference between
an architect and an engineer?

891
01:21:02,409 --> 01:21:04,066
Architect draws houses?

892
01:21:06,551 --> 01:21:08,173
And an engineer?

893
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,594
Also draws houses?

894
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,977
You call that a difference?

895
01:21:20,565 --> 01:21:24,258
An engineer reads music,
an architect plays music

896
01:21:24,293 --> 01:21:28,297
if that's something your
limited brain can process.

897
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:34,303
Why do you always
have to be so cruel?

898
01:21:35,856 --> 01:21:38,203
I'm not completely stupid.

899
01:21:38,238 --> 01:21:41,379
That fucking depends on your
definition of "Completely."

900
01:21:46,418 --> 01:21:47,799
Can we just talk
about something normal?

901
01:21:47,833 --> 01:21:49,180
- Like..
- Like?

902
01:21:49,214 --> 01:21:50,802
What you do,
something like that?

903
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:52,908
Information about what I do.

904
01:21:54,254 --> 01:21:58,120
In simple terms that
a simpleton can understand

905
01:21:58,154 --> 01:21:59,742
is that right, Simple?

906
01:22:01,468 --> 01:22:02,710
Yes.

907
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:08,958
I kill.

908
01:22:11,788 --> 01:22:12,928
Okay.

909
01:22:18,036 --> 01:22:20,797
I've killed 60 people.

910
01:22:23,145 --> 01:22:25,388
I'm a serial killer, Simple.

911
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:30,117
You're weird.

912
01:22:30,152 --> 01:22:32,602
I'm weird?

913
01:22:32,637 --> 01:22:35,674
Why, because I'm saying that
I've killed 61 people?

914
01:22:37,090 --> 01:22:39,092
You said 60 before.

915
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:47,203
If you weren't as dumb
as a fucking doorknob

916
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:49,930
you would be familiar
with the term "Updated."

917
01:22:52,346 --> 01:22:56,350
Just because the number
was 60 an hour ago

918
01:22:56,385 --> 01:22:59,491
doesn't mean that
it can't easily become

919
01:22:59,526 --> 01:23:02,011
61 in just
a couple of minutes.

920
01:23:02,046 --> 01:23:04,013
Well, I'm not dumb
as a doorknob.

921
01:23:05,739 --> 01:23:07,741
Maybe I haven't
read as many books as you.

922
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:10,192
Simple, come on.

923
01:23:10,226 --> 01:23:11,917
You're as dumb as fuck.

924
01:23:14,058 --> 01:23:15,645
Now why don't you be
a good little dreamboat

925
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,303
and go get me a magic marker.

926
01:23:18,338 --> 01:23:20,167
Could you bring me
a magic marker?

927
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:23,964
Red or black?

928
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:26,587
E -- either one's fine.

929
01:25:10,243 --> 01:25:12,037
You're fucking weird.

930
01:25:28,019 --> 01:25:29,158
Excuse me.

931
01:25:29,193 --> 01:25:31,264
- Officer.
- Yeah.

932
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:34,094
My friend is, like,
totally weird

933
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,855
and he said he killed
60 people

934
01:25:36,890 --> 01:25:39,134
or maybe even 61.

935
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:40,997
Have you been drinking?

936
01:25:41,032 --> 01:25:44,173
Um, yeah.

937
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:45,485
Then stop.

938
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:50,110
Everything that this woman
has said..

939
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:52,664
...is true.

940
01:25:55,771 --> 01:25:58,014
I have killed 60 people!

941
01:25:59,188 --> 01:26:01,708
Sixty people!

942
01:26:01,742 --> 01:26:03,192
I'm a serial killer.

943
01:26:03,227 --> 01:26:06,091
Please help me.

944
01:26:06,126 --> 01:26:09,302
I've also been
a horrible human being..

945
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,064
...to this woman right here..

946
01:26:16,723 --> 01:26:18,518
...Ms. Jacqueline.

947
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:26,871
Miss, would you be kind enough
to sweep up your friend here

948
01:26:26,905 --> 01:26:28,666
and take him back inside?

949
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:30,564
I can't order you both
to stop drinking

950
01:26:30,599 --> 01:26:32,187
but I would recommend it.

951
01:27:06,842 --> 01:27:08,568
I can never make it up to you.

952
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:12,710
Never be able
to make it up to you.

953
01:27:27,932 --> 01:27:29,209
Can you forgive me?

954
01:27:31,763 --> 01:27:32,971
Yeah.

955
01:27:37,113 --> 01:27:38,529
I forgive you.

956
01:27:44,535 --> 01:27:47,641
Come on.
Let's go inside.

957
01:27:53,337 --> 01:27:55,649
You need some pills.

958
01:27:55,684 --> 01:27:57,824
I've got a friend
who's got some good pills.

959
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:41,376
Are you leaving?

960
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:48,900
I was just gonna go
get some pills.

961
01:29:57,081 --> 01:30:00,049
Do you have my...my keys?

962
01:30:00,084 --> 01:30:02,604
I'm not gonna take
some random pills.

963
01:30:06,953 --> 01:30:10,266
You know, I really think
I deserve better than this.

964
01:30:14,132 --> 01:30:16,065
I'm gonna hang on to the keys.

965
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:21,519
It's a bad habit for you to

966
01:30:21,554 --> 01:30:24,073
go rushing downstairs
every time

967
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:26,248
we start to have,
have a good time.

968
01:30:28,008 --> 01:30:29,251
Right?

969
01:30:32,323 --> 01:30:35,015
You're walking
without your crutch.

970
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,092
And you weren't
using it downstairs either.

971
01:30:59,557 --> 01:31:02,767
You're Mr. Sophistication,
aren't you?

972
01:31:07,772 --> 01:31:09,567
If you feel like screaming..

973
01:31:11,155 --> 01:31:13,157
....I definitely think
that you should.

974
01:31:32,107 --> 01:31:33,936
You call that screaming?

975
01:31:35,179 --> 01:31:37,699
Help! Help!

976
01:31:39,804 --> 01:31:41,426
Help!

977
01:31:41,461 --> 01:31:43,532
Yes, help!

978
01:31:43,567 --> 01:31:46,121
There's a murderer
in the building!

979
01:31:46,155 --> 01:31:48,088
It's Mr. Sophistication!

980
01:31:48,123 --> 01:31:50,574
Help!

981
01:31:50,608 --> 01:31:52,576
Help!

982
01:31:54,612 --> 01:31:55,958
Shh!

983
01:31:57,650 --> 01:31:59,962
Shh! Hey.

984
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:01,136
Hey. Hey.

985
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,001
Shh!

986
01:32:15,391 --> 01:32:17,704
Do you hear?

987
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:20,224
Do you hear anything?

988
01:32:20,258 --> 01:32:22,882
Do you hear anybody
running downstairs to help?

989
01:32:27,645 --> 01:32:30,234
Some neighbors you have.

990
01:32:30,268 --> 01:32:32,201
You want to try the window?

991
01:32:32,236 --> 01:32:34,479
I just want my keys.

992
01:32:36,620 --> 01:32:39,105
I just want my keys.

993
01:32:39,139 --> 01:32:40,727
I want my keys.

994
01:32:41,970 --> 01:32:44,386
Help!

995
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:46,871
Help!

996
01:32:48,252 --> 01:32:50,944
Help me!

997
01:32:52,325 --> 01:32:54,707
Please help me!

998
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:13,277
You know, maybe I'm mistaken,
but..

999
01:33:13,311 --> 01:33:14,899
...as far as I can tell..

1000
01:33:16,867 --> 01:33:20,180
...not a single light
has gone on

1001
01:33:20,215 --> 01:33:23,045
in any apartment or stairwell.

1002
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,391
You know why that is?

1003
01:33:25,807 --> 01:33:29,189
'Cause in this hell of a town..

1004
01:33:31,019 --> 01:33:32,745
...in this hell of a country..

1005
01:33:34,816 --> 01:33:39,683
...in this hell of a world,
nobody wants to help!

1006
01:33:44,998 --> 01:33:47,760
You can scream..

1007
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:51,073
...from now until Christmas Eve

1008
01:33:51,108 --> 01:33:54,283
and the only answer
you'll get

1009
01:33:54,318 --> 01:33:57,148
is the deafening silence
that you're hearing right now.

1010
01:34:11,818 --> 01:34:13,544
Can't we talk?

1011
01:34:15,408 --> 01:34:18,066
There's a time for talking

1012
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:20,965
and a time for being quiet.

1013
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,209
Open your mouth.

1014
01:34:23,243 --> 01:34:24,900
Open your mouth!

1015
01:34:59,003 --> 01:35:00,487
Okay, Simple.

1016
01:35:00,522 --> 01:35:03,732
Oh, I'm sorry,
Ms. Jacqueline.

1017
01:35:03,767 --> 01:35:07,149
Now, it's time..

1018
01:35:08,633 --> 01:35:10,463
...for you to choose a knife.

1019
01:35:11,671 --> 01:35:13,535
All you have to do is nod.

1020
01:35:16,538 --> 01:35:17,919
No?

1021
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:21,923
What about this one?

1022
01:35:23,269 --> 01:35:25,064
You don't like
that one either?

1023
01:35:25,098 --> 01:35:26,272
Okay.

1024
01:35:28,067 --> 01:35:29,689
How about this one?

1025
01:35:32,519 --> 01:35:33,728
Hmm.

1026
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,110
Well..

1027
01:35:39,457 --> 01:35:41,528
...that's an interesting
choice, Simple.

1028
01:35:53,023 --> 01:35:54,610
You know..

1029
01:35:56,405 --> 01:36:00,375
...there is something that has been
bothering Mr. Sophistication..

1030
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,104
...for quite a bit.

1031
01:36:05,138 --> 01:36:07,865
And perhaps it's more
interesting to him..

1032
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:11,386
....than it would be to you.

1033
01:36:13,733 --> 01:36:16,253
But to be honest

1034
01:36:16,287 --> 01:36:19,463
he gets pretty fuckin' pissed
when he thinks about it.

1035
01:36:20,602 --> 01:36:23,674
Why is it always
the man's fault?

1036
01:36:26,470 --> 01:36:29,749
No matter where you go

1037
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:33,788
it's like you're some sort of
wandering guilty person.

1038
01:36:36,963 --> 01:36:41,278
Without even having harmed
a single kitten.

1039
01:36:44,868 --> 01:36:47,422
I actually get sad
when I think about it.

1040
01:36:53,117 --> 01:36:56,465
If one is so unfortunate..

1041
01:36:58,398 --> 01:37:01,919
...as to have been born male..

1042
01:37:03,507 --> 01:37:05,820
...then you're also born guilty.

1043
01:37:07,994 --> 01:37:10,376
Think of the injustice in that.

1044
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:15,277
Women are always
the victims, right?

1045
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:22,837
And men, they are always
the criminals.

1046
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:47,068
Told you before,
this is private property.

1047
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:51,279
I want you to leave.

1048
01:37:55,628 --> 01:37:59,080
All the king's horses
and all the king's men

1049
01:37:59,114 --> 01:38:02,117
couldn't put Simple
back together again.

1050
01:38:04,464 --> 01:38:06,742
Why are they always so stupid?

1051
01:38:07,778 --> 01:38:09,573
Who's stupid?

1052
01:38:09,607 --> 01:38:14,578
All the women you kill strike
me as seriously unintelligent.

1053
01:38:14,612 --> 01:38:15,993
Come on.

1054
01:38:16,028 --> 01:38:17,822
I've also killed men.

1055
01:38:17,857 --> 01:38:21,067
But you only talk
about the stupid women

1056
01:38:21,102 --> 01:38:25,037
unless you think
all women are stupid.

1057
01:38:25,071 --> 01:38:28,316
Well, the stories I've told
were selected at random, but --

1058
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:32,458
You feel superior to women
and want to brag?

1059
01:38:32,492 --> 01:38:35,323
It turns you on,
doesn't it, Jack?

1060
01:38:35,357 --> 01:38:37,842
No, no,
but women are easier.

1061
01:38:37,877 --> 01:38:41,225
Not physically, they're
just easier to work with.

1062
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:42,571
More cooperative.

1063
01:38:42,606 --> 01:38:44,401
To kill, you mean.

1064
01:38:44,435 --> 01:38:46,161
If you like.

1065
01:38:46,196 --> 01:38:48,819
Mr. Sophistication believes
in that theory.

1066
01:38:48,853 --> 01:38:53,686
So, Mr. Sophistication
is, uh, the theoretician?

1067
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:55,067
I can tell
you're lapping it up

1068
01:38:55,101 --> 01:38:57,724
when I tell you about
Mr. Sophistication.

1069
01:38:57,759 --> 01:38:59,968
"So Jack hears voices

1070
01:39:00,003 --> 01:39:02,729
"that order him
to do this or do that.

1071
01:39:02,764 --> 01:39:04,869
Jack must be psychotic."

1072
01:39:04,904 --> 01:39:07,907
I loathe diagnosis you can
just write down in letters.

1073
01:39:09,702 --> 01:39:13,568
That's not fair,
the letters are clear.

1074
01:39:13,602 --> 01:39:16,398
They look after us
and create boundaries

1075
01:39:16,433 --> 01:39:20,092
between good and evil,
and they carry religion.

1076
01:39:20,126 --> 01:39:22,887
Religion has ruined
human beings

1077
01:39:22,922 --> 01:39:26,684
because your God teaches people
to deny the tiger in themselves

1078
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:29,825
and turns us all
into a throng of slaves

1079
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:31,966
too shameful to acknowledge it.

1080
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,175
Oh, Jack, you should have read

1081
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:36,763
the right letters in your life

1082
01:39:36,798 --> 01:39:39,352
but you didn't want to.

1083
01:39:39,387 --> 01:39:44,254
♪ Fame fame what you like
is in the limo ♪

1084
01:39:44,288 --> 01:39:48,775
♪ Fame fame what you get
is no tomorrow ♪

1085
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:51,606
The collection of corpses were
mostly frozen

1086
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,056
shortly after death

1087
01:39:53,090 --> 01:39:55,920
however, I think a handful
of them, by chance

1088
01:39:55,955 --> 01:40:00,442
had reached, uh, at least, a
certain degree of putrefaction

1089
01:40:00,477 --> 01:40:02,997
before I managed
to get them on ice.

1090
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:06,897
Can you say if putrefaction
is good or evil?

1091
01:40:06,931 --> 01:40:10,073
Most people would say,
it's the natural breakdown

1092
01:40:10,107 --> 01:40:12,696
which, in the end,
is a reaction of matter

1093
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:15,423
which is the basis for life
on earth.

1094
01:40:15,457 --> 01:40:18,253
Thereby, it's neither
particularly good nor evil

1095
01:40:18,288 --> 01:40:21,187
and that a human being must be
perceived as alive

1096
01:40:21,222 --> 01:40:24,018
if you're to describe
that person's qualities

1097
01:40:24,052 --> 01:40:27,193
and identify that person's
ultimate goal.

1098
01:40:27,228 --> 01:40:29,851
But this is where
Mr. Sophistication

1099
01:40:29,885 --> 01:40:32,819
has a very different opinion.

1100
01:40:32,854 --> 01:40:35,581
He argues quite well
that the ultimate goal

1101
01:40:35,615 --> 01:40:38,653
for the human being
is not prior to death

1102
01:40:38,687 --> 01:40:40,206
but after.

1103
01:40:40,241 --> 01:40:43,589
You reduce everything human
to matter

1104
01:40:43,623 --> 01:40:47,248
and that way life disappears
and along with it art

1105
01:40:47,282 --> 01:40:49,698
which you value so highly.

1106
01:40:49,733 --> 01:40:53,668
Verge, you're a bitter
old bastard.

1107
01:40:53,702 --> 01:40:57,913
You kill art by imposing
your moral ruler on life

1108
01:40:57,948 --> 01:40:59,467
which I want to free

1109
01:40:59,501 --> 01:41:02,125
because art is so immeasurably
vaster

1110
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:03,816
than we will ever understand.

1111
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,611
May I illustrate now?

1112
01:41:05,645 --> 01:41:09,166
There is no avoiding it,
is there?

1113
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:16,967
I don't have a handle on
how many processes take part

1114
01:41:17,001 --> 01:41:19,832
in the decay of a dead human

1115
01:41:19,866 --> 01:41:22,214
but I know a bit
about dessert wines.

1116
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:26,666
In order to achieve
the most sublime sweetness

1117
01:41:26,701 --> 01:41:29,186
and the greatest wines,
nature has provided us

1118
01:41:29,221 --> 01:41:30,567
with various methods.

1119
01:41:32,051 --> 01:41:35,606
The three most common forms
of decomposition are

1120
01:41:35,641 --> 01:41:37,539
frost..

1121
01:41:37,574 --> 01:41:39,507
...dehydration..

1122
01:41:39,541 --> 01:41:41,198
...and a fungus
with the enticingly

1123
01:41:41,233 --> 01:41:43,994
mysterious name,
the noble rot.

1124
01:41:51,139 --> 01:41:53,797
The first method is the one
that in Germany

1125
01:41:53,831 --> 01:41:56,386
is used to produce "Eiswein."

1126
01:41:56,420 --> 01:41:58,457
The method
quite simply entails

1127
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:00,804
leaving the grapes on the vine
for so long

1128
01:42:00,838 --> 01:42:04,566
that they are exposed to frost
for a certain number of nights

1129
01:42:04,601 --> 01:42:06,050
before they are pressed.

1130
01:42:06,085 --> 01:42:08,743
This method increases
the sugar content

1131
01:42:08,777 --> 01:42:11,125
in the wine dramatically.

1132
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:14,990
It is very risky, as the grapes
must have certain qualities

1133
01:42:15,025 --> 01:42:18,062
in order to be able to
withstand the process.

1134
01:42:18,097 --> 01:42:20,168
On top of that,
there can be uncertainty

1135
01:42:20,203 --> 01:42:22,515
about whether or not the first
night's frost

1136
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:27,106
lives up precisely to the
expectations, et cetera.

1137
01:42:27,141 --> 01:42:30,420
The second method
is called "Trockenbeeren"

1138
01:42:30,454 --> 01:42:33,008
in which the grapes are
allowed to hang on the vine

1139
01:42:33,043 --> 01:42:37,461
until they dry up and very
nearly become raisins.

1140
01:42:37,496 --> 01:42:39,808
The last method,
which, for example

1141
01:42:39,843 --> 01:42:42,915
is essential for the
production of Sauternes

1142
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:45,159
is a kind of mold
that causes grapes

1143
01:42:45,193 --> 01:42:47,264
to be very full-bodied

1144
01:42:47,299 --> 01:42:51,544
and have an explosively high
sugar content.

1145
01:42:51,579 --> 01:42:53,960
You could say about
all three processes

1146
01:42:53,995 --> 01:42:56,100
that it's the breakdown
that lifts the living grape

1147
01:42:56,135 --> 01:42:57,861
up to be a part of an artwork.

1148
01:42:59,414 --> 01:43:02,452
You can view the processes
that start in a human being

1149
01:43:02,486 --> 01:43:04,695
after death in the same manner.

1150
01:43:04,730 --> 01:43:09,769
Says you! And I still say that
without love there is no art.

1151
01:43:09,804 --> 01:43:12,531
It's not up for debate.

1152
01:43:12,565 --> 01:43:15,223
The thing you are talking
about with the grapes

1153
01:43:15,258 --> 01:43:18,778
is just nature's
method of decomposing.

1154
01:43:18,813 --> 01:43:23,231
If decomposition
is a way to salvation

1155
01:43:23,266 --> 01:43:25,475
then what about your house?

1156
01:43:26,648 --> 01:43:29,030
By God, you cannot convince me

1157
01:43:29,064 --> 01:43:32,136
that the idea of your first
house being torn down

1158
01:43:32,171 --> 01:43:34,518
was, in any way, satisfying.

1159
01:43:34,553 --> 01:43:38,315
Do you claim that
it was built to be torn down?

1160
01:43:39,627 --> 01:43:42,216
No, of course it wasn't ideal

1161
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:43,976
and I'm sorry to say
that it happened

1162
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:46,081
no less than three more times

1163
01:43:46,116 --> 01:43:49,637
that I started construction
and then became doubtful.

1164
01:43:49,671 --> 01:43:51,846
It was difficult to create
the house

1165
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:53,365
that I had dreamed of.

1166
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:56,368
The material didn't do
what I wanted it to do.

1167
01:43:56,402 --> 01:43:58,956
The houses I had drawn
had already

1168
01:43:58,991 --> 01:44:01,407
at the very first detail,
something banal

1169
01:44:01,442 --> 01:44:03,444
not to say ordinary,
about them

1170
01:44:03,478 --> 01:44:07,965
Isn't that what in art
you would call epigonism?

1171
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,106
Your great talent
only reached so far

1172
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:13,661
you, artist of all times.

1173
01:44:15,041 --> 01:44:17,872
When you were writing,
didn't you yourself plan

1174
01:44:17,906 --> 01:44:20,564
the destruction of your most
popular literary work?

1175
01:44:21,807 --> 01:44:24,292
"The Aeneid"
was a commissioned work

1176
01:44:24,327 --> 01:44:28,676
where the ruling power and
its ideas were glorified by me

1177
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:32,611
to the point
where it was no longer art.

1178
01:44:32,645 --> 01:44:35,752
But if glorification
could demean a work..

1179
01:44:37,443 --> 01:44:39,480
...why should destruction
and demolition

1180
01:44:39,514 --> 01:44:42,897
not be able to do the opposite
and create art?

1181
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:48,074
Albert Speer invented
"The Theory of Ruin Value"

1182
01:44:48,109 --> 01:44:50,836
by examining the Greek
and Roman ruins

1183
01:44:50,870 --> 01:44:54,322
and constructed his buildings
using both weaker

1184
01:44:54,357 --> 01:44:55,979
and stronger materials

1185
01:44:56,013 --> 01:44:58,809
so that they, in a thousand
years, would appear

1186
01:44:58,844 --> 01:45:00,777
as aesthetically perfect ruins.

1187
01:45:02,261 --> 01:45:04,884
Which fortunately
were smashed to atoms

1188
01:45:04,919 --> 01:45:09,233
in mere few years
after their construction.

1189
01:45:09,268 --> 01:45:12,685
Hubris is punished by nemesis

1190
01:45:12,720 --> 01:45:15,757
if I may use an old-fashioned
expression.

1191
01:45:15,792 --> 01:45:17,725
But an artist must be cynical

1192
01:45:17,759 --> 01:45:21,970
and not worry about the welfare
of humans or Gods in his art.

1193
01:45:22,005 --> 01:45:24,214
This talk about
the value of ruins

1194
01:45:24,248 --> 01:45:28,114
makes it too obvious, not to
mention, another subject.

1195
01:45:28,149 --> 01:45:29,633
The value of icons.

1196
01:45:47,755 --> 01:45:49,343
The Stuka

1197
01:45:49,377 --> 01:45:52,276
without a doubt the world's
most beautiful airplane

1198
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:56,557
and to top it off featuring an
eerily sophisticated detail.

1199
01:45:56,591 --> 01:45:59,283
I'm sure you know
what I'm talking about.

1200
01:45:59,318 --> 01:46:03,046
No, by God
that has never interested me

1201
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,324
but do tell me about it.

1202
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,188
The Stuka was a dive-bomber.

1203
01:46:07,222 --> 01:46:09,432
They say that the pilots
actually passed out

1204
01:46:09,466 --> 01:46:11,813
for a brief moment
during the actual dive.

1205
01:46:11,848 --> 01:46:14,782
But the detail per favore.

1206
01:46:14,816 --> 01:46:16,439
Fantastic.

1207
01:46:16,473 --> 01:46:17,854
Incomparable.

1208
01:46:17,888 --> 01:46:20,581
Notice the sound
when the plane dives.

1209
01:46:20,615 --> 01:46:23,031
The screeching sound.

1210
01:46:23,066 --> 01:46:26,897
A result of poor design
if you ask me.

1211
01:46:26,932 --> 01:46:29,831
Poor design, please.

1212
01:46:29,866 --> 01:46:33,870
On the contrary,
the screeching was intrinsic

1213
01:46:33,904 --> 01:46:37,321
sirens were attached to
the undercarriage of the plane

1214
01:46:37,356 --> 01:46:42,292
purposely designed as a
psychological act of war.

1215
01:46:42,326 --> 01:46:46,469
No one who heard it in action
will ever forget that sound.

1216
01:46:46,503 --> 01:46:49,403
It made the blood run cold
in everyone's veins.

1217
01:46:50,369 --> 01:46:52,406
Known as Jericho's Trumpet.

1218
01:46:54,477 --> 01:46:57,272
Sadistic, but in your eyes

1219
01:46:57,307 --> 01:46:59,689
probably a masterpiece.

1220
01:46:59,723 --> 01:47:03,520
No, more than a masterpiece.

1221
01:47:04,176 --> 01:47:06,178
An icon.

1222
01:47:06,212 --> 01:47:09,043
The person or persons,
who conceived the Stuka

1223
01:47:09,077 --> 01:47:12,529
and its functions,
were icon-creators.

1224
01:47:12,564 --> 01:47:14,393
What I'm getting at is this

1225
01:47:14,428 --> 01:47:16,153
as disinclined
as the world is

1226
01:47:16,188 --> 01:47:19,156
to acknowledge
the beauty of decay

1227
01:47:19,191 --> 01:47:22,539
it's just as disinclined
to give credit to those

1228
01:47:22,574 --> 01:47:25,093
no credit to us

1229
01:47:25,128 --> 01:47:27,717
who create the real icons
of this planet.

1230
01:47:29,201 --> 01:47:30,789
We are deemed
the ultimate evil.

1231
01:47:35,138 --> 01:47:39,349
All the icons that have had
and always will have

1232
01:47:39,383 --> 01:47:41,040
an impact on the world

1233
01:47:41,075 --> 01:47:43,698
are for me extravagant art.

1234
01:47:55,986 --> 01:47:57,643
The noble rot.

1235
01:47:57,678 --> 01:48:01,958
Stop it...you Antichrist!

1236
01:48:01,992 --> 01:48:04,478
I don't recall ever having
escorted

1237
01:48:04,512 --> 01:48:08,516
a so thoroughly depraved
person as you, Jack.

1238
01:48:11,485 --> 01:48:14,695
Since you have now apparently
set your heart

1239
01:48:14,729 --> 01:48:17,145
in mass extermination

1240
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:19,493
let me make a brief comment

1241
01:48:19,527 --> 01:48:22,047
about the Buchenwald camp

1242
01:48:22,081 --> 01:48:27,293
that emphasizes my attitude
towards art and love.

1243
01:48:27,328 --> 01:48:31,574
In the middle of this
concentration camp stood a tree

1244
01:48:31,608 --> 01:48:34,335
and not just any old tree,
but an oak

1245
01:48:34,369 --> 01:48:37,994
and not just any oak,
but the one Goethe

1246
01:48:38,028 --> 01:48:39,685
when he was young,
sat beneath

1247
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:44,448
and wrote some of humanity's
most important works.

1248
01:48:44,483 --> 01:48:45,726
Goethe.

1249
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,383
Here you can talk about
masterpieces

1250
01:48:48,418 --> 01:48:51,076
and the value of icons.

1251
01:48:51,110 --> 01:48:54,838
The personification
of humanism, dignity

1252
01:48:54,873 --> 01:48:59,636
culture and goodness
was by the irony of faith

1253
01:48:59,671 --> 01:49:01,742
suddenly present

1254
01:49:01,776 --> 01:49:04,399
in the middle of one
of the all time

1255
01:49:04,434 --> 01:49:07,368
greatest crimes
against humanity.

1256
01:49:09,370 --> 01:49:11,993
Some people claim
that the atrocities we commit

1257
01:49:12,028 --> 01:49:14,686
in our fiction
are those inner desires

1258
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:18,828
which we cannot commit in our
controlled civilization.

1259
01:49:18,862 --> 01:49:22,176
So they are expressed instead
through our art.

1260
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:24,143
I don't agree.

1261
01:49:24,178 --> 01:49:27,422
I believe heaven and hell
are one and the same.

1262
01:49:27,457 --> 01:49:31,703
The soul belongs to heaven
and the body to hell.

1263
01:49:31,737 --> 01:49:36,397
The soul is reason and the body
is all the dangerous things

1264
01:49:36,431 --> 01:49:39,227
for example art and icons.

1265
01:49:43,369 --> 01:49:45,302
Let me finish
with a curiosity.

1266
01:49:47,373 --> 01:49:49,030
I've always considered it
ridiculous

1267
01:49:49,065 --> 01:49:50,894
when I've heard about the
serial killer's

1268
01:49:50,929 --> 01:49:52,758
favorite trophy.

1269
01:49:52,793 --> 01:49:54,277
Here you are, Jack.

1270
01:49:55,761 --> 01:49:59,040
And yet I let myself be
tempted to not let

1271
01:49:59,075 --> 01:50:01,146
Simple's other breast
go to waste

1272
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:03,873
but have it prepared and sown.

1273
01:50:03,907 --> 01:50:05,944
Also a small icon.

1274
01:50:07,152 --> 01:50:08,463
Thank you, sir.

1275
01:50:35,939 --> 01:50:37,838
Do you wanna fucking die?

1276
01:50:39,909 --> 01:50:42,774
- No.
- Then do what I fucking say.

1277
01:50:45,880 --> 01:50:47,433
Do what I say!

1278
01:50:49,953 --> 01:50:51,334
Unlock it.

1279
01:50:53,232 --> 01:50:54,578
Drop the keys.

1280
01:50:55,856 --> 01:50:57,374
Turn around.

1281
01:50:59,756 --> 01:51:00,688
Cuff.

1282
01:51:01,862 --> 01:51:02,863
Cuff!

1283
01:51:39,934 --> 01:51:41,073
Kneel down.

1284
01:51:45,215 --> 01:51:47,355
We're freezing.

1285
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:49,288
One of the others
fainted earlier.

1286
01:51:50,773 --> 01:51:52,153
We're dying of cold.

1287
01:51:53,258 --> 01:51:54,708
We're dying.

1288
01:51:58,504 --> 01:52:00,472
Really? "We're freezing."

1289
01:52:02,405 --> 01:52:04,959
I guess I owe you gentlemen
an explanation.

1290
01:52:08,722 --> 01:52:11,000
During World War II
on the eastern front

1291
01:52:11,034 --> 01:52:15,383
German soldiers had large
programs of executions

1292
01:52:15,418 --> 01:52:17,903
but were in short supply
of ammunition

1293
01:52:17,938 --> 01:52:22,874
so they experimented with the
execution of several individuals

1294
01:52:22,908 --> 01:52:26,015
with one,
just one single bullet.

1295
01:52:26,049 --> 01:52:28,914
Now as a tribute
to that, uh, ingenuity..

1296
01:52:30,882 --> 01:52:34,402
...I'm going to conduct a small
experiment of my own.

1297
01:52:35,541 --> 01:52:37,302
I'm going to use..

1298
01:52:40,029 --> 01:52:42,479
...a full metal jacket bullet

1299
01:52:42,514 --> 01:52:44,309
which has the capacity

1300
01:52:44,343 --> 01:52:47,519
to pass through each and every
one of your heads.

1301
01:52:47,553 --> 01:52:50,004
That's not something
that I would be able to do

1302
01:52:50,039 --> 01:52:51,972
with basic hunting ammunition.

1303
01:52:54,043 --> 01:52:56,286
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, sir, sir.

1304
01:52:56,321 --> 01:52:58,392
I -- it's a
misunderstanding, sir.

1305
01:52:58,426 --> 01:52:59,842
- I hear that a lot.
- No, sir.

1306
01:52:59,876 --> 01:53:01,119
W -- what I mean is
that you are wrong

1307
01:53:01,153 --> 01:53:03,535
about the ammunition, sir.

1308
01:53:03,569 --> 01:53:06,710
That is not full metal
ammunition, sir.

1309
01:53:06,745 --> 01:53:09,058
I'm a military man,
and I know, sir.

1310
01:53:13,407 --> 01:53:14,477
Fuck.

1311
01:53:15,823 --> 01:53:19,137
You're right!
This is a hunting round.

1312
01:53:23,451 --> 01:53:26,040
This box, it's -- it's
completely mislabeled.

1313
01:53:26,075 --> 01:53:27,524
Goddammit!

1314
01:53:29,906 --> 01:53:32,667
Forgive me, gentlemen,
I'm gonna have to, uh

1315
01:53:32,702 --> 01:53:33,876
step out for a moment.

1316
01:53:35,636 --> 01:53:39,605
I know it's not
an ideal situation.

1317
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:43,057
Don't die on me guys, okay?

1318
01:54:15,779 --> 01:54:18,230
I've never yelled
at you before, Al

1319
01:54:18,265 --> 01:54:20,405
but I'm about to now.

1320
01:54:20,439 --> 01:54:22,856
What does that look like to you,
what does that say there?

1321
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:26,066
Uh, thirty odd six..

1322
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:28,378
- Thirty odd six, that's correct.
- Yeah.

1323
01:54:28,413 --> 01:54:30,691
It also says full metal jacket.

1324
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:34,143
And when I look inside..

1325
01:54:36,628 --> 01:54:38,837
Get me a goddamn box, Al,
and this time

1326
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:42,910
make sure it's got full metal
jacket bullets in it!

1327
01:54:42,945 --> 01:54:46,880
Is it too much to fucking ask
that the contents of the box

1328
01:54:46,914 --> 01:54:49,744
match what's written
on the label?

1329
01:54:49,779 --> 01:54:52,920
I can, I can see
that the, you're right

1330
01:54:52,955 --> 01:54:55,889
the label doesn't
quite match the..

1331
01:54:57,338 --> 01:54:58,546
...uh, content.

1332
01:54:58,581 --> 01:55:00,963
- W -- well, that's correct.
- Yeah, but..

1333
01:55:00,997 --> 01:55:03,344
The thing is that
what I can't see

1334
01:55:03,379 --> 01:55:06,692
is that the -- the..

1335
01:55:06,727 --> 01:55:11,387
...the box was bought here
in the shop.

1336
01:55:11,421 --> 01:55:12,664
Uh..

1337
01:55:12,698 --> 01:55:15,598
Well I buy all my shit here.

1338
01:55:15,632 --> 01:55:17,738
I have, for 20 years.

1339
01:55:17,772 --> 01:55:22,294
I'm in here
almost every other week.

1340
01:55:22,329 --> 01:55:23,744
What's wrong with you, Al?

1341
01:55:25,125 --> 01:55:26,885
I'm sorry,
I need to see a receipt.

1342
01:55:27,817 --> 01:55:29,336
- Receipt?
- Yeah

1343
01:55:29,370 --> 01:55:31,027
Well, I don't have a fuckin'
receipt.

1344
01:55:31,062 --> 01:55:33,340
I don't ever recall getting a
receipt here.

1345
01:55:33,374 --> 01:55:35,100
Now I'm in a fucking hurry.

1346
01:55:35,135 --> 01:55:37,551
Let me buy a new box.

1347
01:55:37,585 --> 01:55:38,966
But this time make sure
it contains

1348
01:55:39,001 --> 01:55:40,519
full metal jacket bullets.

1349
01:55:43,074 --> 01:55:47,216
Okay, uh, c -- can I just see
some ID first?

1350
01:55:48,596 --> 01:55:49,943
Don't fucking do this, Al.

1351
01:55:49,977 --> 01:55:53,947
The thing is, the -- the law
requires that I have --

1352
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:55,155
How about this..

1353
01:55:55,189 --> 01:55:57,053
No doubt about
your -- your identity --

1354
01:55:57,088 --> 01:55:59,262
Sell me just one full metal
jacket bullet.

1355
01:55:59,297 --> 01:56:01,747
Can I, can I just ask..

1356
01:56:04,026 --> 01:56:06,338
...why just...one?

1357
01:56:06,373 --> 01:56:08,375
Well, that will be none of your
fuckin' business.

1358
01:56:08,409 --> 01:56:10,204
- That -- that's right. I'm sor --
- Okay?

1359
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:13,069
I do business here because you
don't ask stupid questions.

1360
01:56:13,104 --> 01:56:17,280
I'm -- I'm sorry, Jack.
I'm -- I'm sorry.

1361
01:56:17,315 --> 01:56:20,594
- Shut it down, Al, go home, have a sandwich.
- Okay.

1362
01:56:20,628 --> 01:56:21,940
You've lost
your fucking mind, Al.

1363
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,838
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm so..

I need a full metal jacket
cartridge.

1375
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:25,831
Yesterday,
the police visited Al

1376
01:57:25,866 --> 01:57:28,006
and then me

1377
01:57:28,041 --> 01:57:30,422
with lights and sirens

1378
01:57:30,457 --> 01:57:31,596
to get you.

1379
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:34,978
It's over now, Jack.

1380
01:57:37,705 --> 01:57:38,982
What's over?

1381
01:57:40,363 --> 01:57:42,296
They know what you've done.

1382
01:57:46,024 --> 01:57:47,888
We..

1383
01:57:47,922 --> 01:57:49,959
Alright, what have I done?

1384
01:57:50,753 --> 01:57:52,099
The robbery.

1385
01:57:53,687 --> 01:57:55,033
Robbery?

1386
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:57,691
You guys better
fucking get it together.

1387
01:57:57,725 --> 01:58:00,383
I haven't robbed anybody.

1388
01:58:00,418 --> 01:58:02,109
This is ridiculous.

1389
01:58:04,353 --> 01:58:07,080
I'm gonna call the police, Jack.

1390
01:58:08,874 --> 01:58:10,497
Give me your gun.

1391
01:58:12,292 --> 01:58:14,915
I don't run around
with guns on me.

1392
01:58:14,949 --> 01:58:17,573
This is, this is crazy.

1393
01:58:17,607 --> 01:58:19,402
Sit yourself down, Jack.

1394
01:58:32,898 --> 01:58:34,590
This is S.P.

1395
01:58:36,454 --> 01:58:38,111
I wanna get ahold of Rob.

1396
01:58:43,944 --> 01:58:45,877
Well, when you get hold of him,
you'll tell him

1397
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:47,879
to get over here straight away.

1398
01:58:49,777 --> 01:58:51,572
I've caught Jack.

1399
01:58:59,891 --> 01:59:02,135
I'm kind of glad that you are
the one that caught me.

1400
01:59:06,553 --> 01:59:08,382
Perhaps you don't know this..

1401
01:59:10,591 --> 01:59:12,973
...but I think of you
as my best friend.

1402
01:59:16,942 --> 01:59:19,290
Now that might not be
a big deal to you..

1403
01:59:21,154 --> 01:59:24,467
...but you've meant
a great deal to me.

1404
01:59:28,506 --> 01:59:31,612
It feels quite nice
knowing that it's all over.

1405
01:59:38,688 --> 01:59:41,208
Somebody had to free me

1406
01:59:41,243 --> 01:59:45,661
and stop me from stealing things
that don't belong to me.

1407
01:59:47,421 --> 01:59:50,424
And that someone
turned out to be you.

1408
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:56,430
Do you remember the time you
took down that eight pointer

1409
01:59:56,465 --> 01:59:58,501
that I'd been tracking
for four days?

1410
02:00:01,608 --> 02:00:04,611
It was on my territory
for sure.

1411
02:00:04,645 --> 02:00:06,854
No one's questioning that.

1412
02:00:06,889 --> 02:00:08,615
You've always been
a great shot.

1413
02:00:10,272 --> 02:00:13,861
Now would you, uh,
quit pointing that gun at me?

1414
02:00:15,277 --> 02:00:17,244
Kind of hurting my feelings
a little bit.

1415
02:00:19,591 --> 02:00:21,421
I'm not going anywhere.

1416
02:00:23,146 --> 02:00:25,114
After all you know me, S.P.

1417
02:00:30,982 --> 02:00:31,914
Yeah.

1418
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:34,848
I know you.

1419
02:00:38,300 --> 02:00:40,716
And you've never lied to me.

1420
02:00:41,510 --> 02:00:42,787
No.

1421
02:00:52,659 --> 02:00:55,869
Just as fast
as I always was, huh?

1422
02:00:58,043 --> 02:01:00,045
You wouldn't make it
to the door.

1423
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:07,708
What have I done?

1424
02:02:38,799 --> 02:02:40,076
You got him, S.P.

1425
02:02:42,078 --> 02:02:44,426
Well, I'll take it from here.

1426
02:03:25,398 --> 02:03:26,951
Can we agree on this?

1427
02:03:28,711 --> 02:03:30,886
Is that a full metal jacket
cartridge?

1428
02:03:34,061 --> 02:03:36,823
Yes, sir. That is..

1429
02:03:36,857 --> 02:03:39,826
That is a full metal jacket
rifle cartridge.

1430
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:41,241
Oh, please, please

1431
02:03:41,275 --> 02:03:43,208
please, don't do this, please.

1432
02:03:43,243 --> 02:03:45,763
- Alright, come on.
- Don't do it, please!

1433
02:04:36,192 --> 02:04:37,400
No, no.

1434
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:39,851
I can't focus.

1435
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:42,129
It's too close.

1436
02:06:47,323 --> 02:06:48,531
Perfect.

1437
02:06:55,159 --> 02:06:56,470
Jack!

1438
02:07:04,306 --> 02:07:05,687
Jack!

1439
02:07:26,708 --> 02:07:27,778
Who are you?

1440
02:07:28,675 --> 02:07:30,090
Call me Verge.

1441
02:07:36,545 --> 02:07:38,340
How did you get in here?

1442
02:07:41,446 --> 02:07:42,655
What do you want?

1443
02:07:43,725 --> 02:07:46,313
As I see it,
it's you who called me.

1444
02:07:54,839 --> 02:07:58,774
I've been with you for a while,
you just didn't notice me.

1445
02:08:14,997 --> 02:08:18,138
So, did you come here
to stop me?

1446
02:08:20,693 --> 02:08:23,350
I haven't come here to stop you
from anything.

1447
02:08:23,385 --> 02:08:25,836
I just have one question.

1448
02:08:28,562 --> 02:08:31,117
What's the question?

1449
02:08:31,151 --> 02:08:34,810
Wasn't there something about
you building a house?

1450
02:08:37,019 --> 02:08:39,884
Wasn't Jack going to
build a house?

1451
02:08:48,582 --> 02:08:49,791
Yes.

1452
02:08:52,034 --> 02:08:55,106
I -- I -- I was..

1453
02:08:59,801 --> 02:09:01,043
...trying..

1454
02:09:02,217 --> 02:09:04,081
...but I didn't get very far.

1455
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:21,546
This is the police.

1456
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:24,308
Come out with your hands
where we can see them

1457
02:09:29,934 --> 02:09:32,626
I can see it's going to be
a bit difficult

1458
02:09:32,661 --> 02:09:35,698
to get that house built,
but perhaps another one.

1459
02:09:39,219 --> 02:09:42,119
Think, Jack, after all
you are an engineer

1460
02:09:42,153 --> 02:09:44,224
and call yourself an architect.

1461
02:09:51,162 --> 02:09:53,509
I've been told you have an
interesting theory

1462
02:09:53,544 --> 02:09:56,789
about the material

1463
02:09:56,823 --> 02:10:00,206
which you claim
has its own will.

1464
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:03,209
Find the material, Jack

1465
02:10:03,243 --> 02:10:05,211
and let it do the work.

1466
02:10:58,574 --> 02:11:00,922
Your house is a fine little
house, Jack.

1467
02:11:04,270 --> 02:11:06,065
It's absolutely usable.

1468
02:11:24,255 --> 02:11:25,878
Are you coming, Jack?

1469
02:12:13,995 --> 02:12:17,895
I'm here...Jack.

1470
02:12:26,007 --> 02:12:28,181
May I ask you something?

1471
02:12:28,216 --> 02:12:30,494
I can't promise I'll answer.

1472
02:12:31,944 --> 02:12:34,705
R -- right,
that is exactly what I meant.

1473
02:12:36,051 --> 02:12:38,812
Um, are you allowed to speak
along the way?

1474
02:12:40,124 --> 02:12:42,368
I was thinking
there might be rules.

1475
02:12:43,541 --> 02:12:44,991
Put it this way

1476
02:12:45,026 --> 02:12:48,857
very few make it all the way
without uttering a word.

1477
02:12:48,891 --> 02:12:51,101
People are overcome
with a strange

1478
02:12:51,135 --> 02:12:54,483
and sudden need
to confess on these trips.

1479
02:12:54,518 --> 02:12:56,382
And not all of it can be said

1480
02:12:56,416 --> 02:13:00,006
to be of great
rhetorical quality

1481
02:13:00,041 --> 02:13:01,870
but do carry on merrily

1482
02:13:01,904 --> 02:13:04,597
just don't believe you're
going to tell me something

1483
02:13:04,631 --> 02:13:06,564
I haven't heard before.

1484
02:14:44,835 --> 02:14:46,630
Do you hear a buzzing sound?

1485
02:14:46,664 --> 02:14:47,596
Yes.

1486
02:14:48,804 --> 02:14:50,841
And I don't think
you want to know

1487
02:14:50,875 --> 02:14:52,636
where it's coming from.

1488
02:14:56,502 --> 02:14:58,090
I wanna know everything.

1489
02:14:59,815 --> 02:15:02,163
For thousands of years
human beings

1490
02:15:02,197 --> 02:15:05,062
have tried to localize hell.

1491
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:06,443
Among other methods

1492
02:15:06,477 --> 02:15:10,309
by seeking the sound
it generates.

1493
02:15:10,343 --> 02:15:14,968
One shouldn't focus on
extracting screams and wailing

1494
02:15:15,003 --> 02:15:18,179
because the cries of pain
of so many millions

1495
02:15:18,213 --> 02:15:20,664
of individuals together..

1496
02:15:22,666 --> 02:15:25,117
...becomes what you have
just heard.

1497
02:15:25,151 --> 02:15:28,016
A buzzing sound whose intensity

1498
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:30,777
will increase
as we get ever closer

1499
02:15:30,812 --> 02:15:33,090
to the presence of suffering.

1500
02:17:04,975 --> 02:17:06,356
Verge?

1501
02:17:06,390 --> 02:17:08,185
I'm here, Jack.

1502
02:17:18,782 --> 02:17:20,784
I don't feel so good, Verge.

1503
02:17:24,857 --> 02:17:26,790
There's a sour taste
in my mouth.

1504
02:17:28,170 --> 02:17:31,726
You want me to show you the way
to the next whiskey bar?

1505
02:19:11,826 --> 02:19:14,346
Those are the Elysian Fields.

1506
02:19:17,901 --> 02:19:19,799
We don't have access here.

1507
02:21:22,163 --> 02:21:25,338
That's how deep
the deepest hell goes.

1508
02:21:32,967 --> 02:21:36,004
It's actually not here
I'm to deliver you..

1509
02:21:37,799 --> 02:21:40,215
...however improbable
that may sound..

1510
02:21:41,389 --> 02:21:43,598
...but a couple of circles
higher up.

1511
02:21:51,261 --> 02:21:54,022
I took you down here
as a kind of a favor..

1512
02:21:55,541 --> 02:21:59,649
...because you did after all
give me a little to chew on

1513
02:21:59,683 --> 02:22:01,996
with your story,
and I understood

1514
02:22:02,030 --> 02:22:04,239
that you wanted to see it all.

1515
02:22:20,290 --> 02:22:24,018
When you are done looking,
we'll turn back.

1516
02:22:28,954 --> 02:22:30,818
Where does that path lead?

1517
02:22:31,853 --> 02:22:33,303
On the other side.

1518
02:22:35,650 --> 02:22:40,206
It leads out of hell and up.

1519
02:22:42,795 --> 02:22:46,281
As you can see
there was once a bridge

1520
02:22:46,316 --> 02:22:48,352
but that was before my time.

1521
02:22:57,189 --> 02:23:00,606
Isn't it possible
to climb all the way around?

1522
02:23:04,576 --> 02:23:05,887
This way..

1523
02:23:07,268 --> 02:23:09,235
...and make it over
to the other side?

1524
02:23:11,652 --> 02:23:15,172
Quite a few have tried,
but I have to say..

1525
02:23:16,380 --> 02:23:18,348
...never successfully.

1526
02:23:28,807 --> 02:23:31,603
I wouldn't recommend it

1527
02:23:31,637 --> 02:23:35,020
but the choice
is entirely yours.

1528
02:23:44,063 --> 02:23:45,547
I'll take my chance.

1529
02:24:02,426 --> 02:24:03,842
Bye, Jack.

1530
02:24:05,015 --> 02:24:06,499
